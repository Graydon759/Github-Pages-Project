# A page about me (Graydon Leongkaye)
## And about my experience with Markdown
I am a student at UCSD and a computer science major. I have only recently started coding but I have really enjoyed learning about it. This is the first time I have ever done something in markdown so the following page will be a combination of information about me and me messing with markdown.

> One of the first things I learned in programming was the for loop (this is quoting text)
An example of code (C++) of what a typical for loop looks like:
```
    for(int i = 0; i < 10; i++){
        cout << i << " ";
    }
```
This bit of code would print out 0 to 9 with a space in between them

Something that I like besides coding is playing video games. I have been playing video games for most of my life and have a wide variety. My favorite game is Minecraft. The following is an image of Minecraft.

A cool fact about minecraft is that it is the highest selling game of all time (well at least until GTA6 comes out).
